# Brownian Motion Simulation using Langevin Dynamics

This project simulates the 2D trajectory of a Brownian particle in an optical trap using Langevin dynamics. The simulation models the effects of viscous drag, stochastic thermal noise, and the restoring optical force, solving Langevin‚Äôs stochastic differential equation via a finite difference approach.

## üß™ Overview

- Simulates passive and active Brownian motion in a viscous fluid
- Models an optically trapped particle subject to:
  - Drag force
  - Thermal (stochastic) noise
  - Optical restoring force
- Implements Langevin‚Äôs equation in two dimensions
- Outputs particle trajectories over time
